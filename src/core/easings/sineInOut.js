 * The <code>sineInOut</code> function combines the motion of the sineIn() and sineOut() methods to start the motion from a zero velocity, accelerate motion, then decelerate to a zero velocity.
 * <p>A sinusoidal equation is based on a sine or cosine function. Either one produces a sine waveâ€”a periodic oscillation of a specific shape.</p>
 * <p>This is the equation on which I based the easing curve : <code>p(t) = sin( t &#42; Math.PI / 2 )</code></p>

 * @param {number} b - Specifies the initial value of the animation property.
